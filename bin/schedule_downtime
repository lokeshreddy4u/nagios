# Write a command to the Nagios command file to cause
# it to schedule service downtime.
#
# Based on the example event handler scripts and cmd.c/.cgi
#
# Requires:
#  GNU Date (for date formatting options)
#  Bash > 2.x (for inline variable regex substitution on the comment_data)

# Notes: 
# 1) In order for Nagios to process any commands that
#    are written to the command file, you must enable
#    the check_external_commands option in the main
#    configuration file.

# Caveats:
#  Using "date" to validate the command line date format doesn't always pick
# up all mistakes in the date format. Sometimes "date" seems to invent something
# that might have been what you intented.
#  Makes no attempt to verify the hostname or service desc before passing them to
# the command pipe. Nagios seems to ignore the command if it doesn't match.
# Write a command to the Nagios command file to cause
# it to schedule host downtime

# There are utilities such as "shellsupport" that will do date manipulation allowing shell scripts
# to wrap around this command to schedule for days in advance instead of same date.
